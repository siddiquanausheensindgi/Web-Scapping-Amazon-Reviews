0,Babu,Review OnePlus 6T,3.0 out of 5 stars,"First & Foremost, I would say the Phone is a Beast ! Of course since the Processor is 845 Soc & 6 GB with 128 GB is a good specs in terms of the pricing ....I don't know how the Hype for the OnePlus is going on and people fall prey to it. Its purely a marketing strategy but for the Specs cost is justified.Read till the last for my last suggestion1) I ordered the phone on Nov 1 as per the Offer Plan, I'm sure this is the best Offer one can get and I'm sure the next Offer will be when OnePlus 7 will be about to launch.2) The Phone is quite difficult to handle for someone who has been using a 4-5 Inch range phones for over the years. I would not recommend the OnePlus Switch as the phone gets heated even for a 15 minutes of transfer and 5GB of Data and its better you do the transfer one by one after getting the phone up and running.3) The UI Update and Night Mode update happened as soon as I got the Wi-Fi in place and they happened within 5 minutes.4) The Camera is real cool and I did take some night shots and day shots and got it reviewed with my friend who is Pro Photographer and his comment was its really cool5) The Phone charge is yet to be certified by me and the main reason I purchased this phone due to my charge retain issue, this is my 5 Phone in the last 10 years and every phone that i use comes for a days charge in the beginning, But this came for 1 day and 15 hours. Although I did a bit of gaming for the first time. Trust me any phone in the market will have a battery issue after 1 or 2 years of usage. I need to review this - But for sure will Update this Point in next 3 Months6) The App that I use for news review such as Inshorts & Dailyhunt seem to be not responsive & I did gave a feedback to them to design for such 6.41 Inch phones as these seem to be like a cricket pitch screen. So you can guess how it will be for other apps. This is my personal review.7) The power draining rate is 1% per every 8 minutes when in use and 16-20 minutes when not in use. This is just a random check that I did in the past 2 days with Wi-Fi and 4 minutes & 15-18 minutes when in Network coverage like Airtel & Jio, don't worry this number will reduce in just few months of usage8) The Phone gets heated up when surfing with Airtel Internet for more than 30 minutes continuously with good signal in open area9) The charging rate is good, I'm sure the charging rate will always remain to be good, its the discharge rate that will drastically vary as the phone gets old. don't worry this number will reduce in just few months of usage10) Even though the phone is a gorilla glass there is a screen protector added to this phone, which in my opinion was not needed, I've used S2 from samsung, G4, X Play from Moto, all without screen protector. In this case I don't like this.11) I've used the phone with google maps ""ON"" when driving in my car, the phone discharge rate was around 4-6 minutes appx , although the issue that I faced was there is no car charger from OnePlus on Amazon, at the time of writing this review. So I had to toggle the maps to Aero-plane mode after downloading the maps for my route.12) Go for this phone only if you are okay with spending such a huge money. To me after purchasing this phone I felt we can change the phone every year for a price rage of 10k rather than changing this phone after 2 years. That's up to the individual and their desire to change from time to time. I felt disappointed after using this phone in other areas.13) The In Screen Finger Scanner is a night mare. Did you hear 0.4 Sec, Just Sh*t, it took me more than 5 attempts to get the screen un lock. I'm not saying any false Information here ... Trust ME ! Tried in all angle by enabling for all fingers in all possible configuration. VERY BAD ...14) The face Un lock is excellent. No comments here15) Head Phone Jack, Yes when we accepted the USB compared to a printer port, Fax Port, Screen Port, Keyboard, Mouse, the head phone from 3.5mm to Micro should be well received in the industry. They have given a converter too for those using the jack during CAR TRAVEL ...I will update other factors after further review. TRUST ME, I will put this phone in SECOND TO NONE may be soon.As of Now I would say 5 star under standard test conditions but 3 star under usage conditionTrust Me friends, don't waste your money with this phone as the positives will surely switch to negatives in just a matter of few months as any battery in industry is not going to give up 100% performance. Even if you put double 845 Soc with double 6/8 GB RAM or double 128GB space or even double camera"
1,Madhu,Sucks!,3.0 out of 5 stars,Evrything sucks with this phoneðŸ™‚
2,Vicky Joshi,Make sure you read description First not stars only #Pubg,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Well if you are moving from another brand to 6T than u will surely give almost 5 stars but I am using 3T since its launched and 5t from last 6 months so it's not giving me lots of supises which I was expected.Cons:- length is too much, not possible to operate with one hand or typing and some other task will be more though than you ever imagined.- no headphone jack and that dongle is not that much of robust like many times its got unplugged in pocket. Need to buy type C bullets now- front camera is overall average and as phone is not handy pictures will be blurred many times- NO Notification Light (sad react only)- I am tired now while writing this post- Its not that much of bright as compared to 3T in dark room- In display finger print is not working sometimes especially when your hands are dirty like dust and wet and slow to compare 3t n 5t or even many times display blinks and notification panel comes down software bugs I can say..- Round corners are creating a weirdo view in many applications and it's feel faulty.- That dewdrop notch is really really annoying while using some applications and your eyes will move there multiple times- notification icons are very small and sometimes hide when there are many including network speed- Phone is very heavy, well I am 6 ft tall and beast too yet it's annoying so think about it when you are girl where hands are soft and small :p- There are lots of software bugs which I can say they will fix in sometimes #hopeWhy I choose to upgrade because 3T is now old for me and I needed new UI and Latest chip and OnePlus performance was always good and based on personal experience I can't think about another flagship, well Note 9 was in cart earlier but almost 20k more after discount seems bad deal so 6T becomes final choice..- After some rounds of PubG you will tired as phone is big and heavyProns:- 7 hours continues play in Pubg with HDR and High frame rates, awesome experience like never before even in 5T. I am already in ace tire and now trying to reach in top 500 players and this device will surely helps me.- Pictures Quality is amazing when you click photos through rear camera now I will have surely a great pictures of Diwali 2018- Night mode is unbelievable when I clicked picture of my bed with lights off OMG.- Sound is 20% more loud than 3t and 5t its feels- It was 20% charged after 11 hours of using including two classic solo games in Pubg top 3 both the time which was I consider as surprise.- User experience is good and oygen os trying to show every information in a good manners.I have written above details based on 2 days of usage and I will again update this after this week of usage. Personal Suggestion, please invest more money in mid night black than mirror black you will thank me later as I ordered two 6T both the variants."
3,sanjay,Just OK,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Some Cons relative to the price :1) Camera could have be better (as you get from Oppo and Vivo at this price)2) Speakers could have been little louder (as you get from Oppo and Vivo at this price)3) On-screen Finger sensor is slower and not as responsive as I have  on Moto, iphone (used in past).4) No-Radio chip and i am missing it alot  (didn't paid attention to it before ordering but seems all flagship mobiles like iphone Samsung S* etc)5) Screen Brightness just feels on lower side at this price. sub 20K phones seems to have better brightness6) feels little heavier esp when holding between thumb and index finger to view videos.7) taking call is swipe down as compared to most of the android swipe up or right. I am still unable to forget my old habit after 1 week of use :-)8) not many content available in 19.5:9 aspect ratio. so most of the videos or app support expansion to cover the full screen which cuts out the some (little) portion. (problem with almost all mobiles coming with 19.5:9 ratio.9) Screen gaurd fitted by default doesn't feel of the good quality. Scratches coming very easily.10) no Ear-Phone headset is big surprise at this price. even sub 20K mobiles includes it as bare minimum.11) either charge or use ear-phone at one given time as no separate 3.5mm jack provisioned.12) Amazon took almost 1 week to deliver this product. looks like availability has been challenged.Pros :1) Face unlock is super fast works like magic.2) Overall mobile feels sturdy and solid esp with the enclosed back cover.3) OS is very responsive and works seamless so far4) Display is very crsip and clear. (Brightness is felt little low).5) Mobile singnal receiptions is very good (compared to last Moto-G5 experience)6) Internet browsing is fast with the improved hardware configuration of 6GB memory and good processor (845)7) Charging is ok - 10% to 100% in 1.5 hrs and charger quality and cable also feels very good.8) type-C to 3.5mm convertor is a bonus included in the box."
4,Katipally Shiva,"Worst Phone, not flagship killer, a flagship loser, please don't waste your money and valuable time",1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second OnePlus phone, after a very bad experience with the previous one and I took it on the hope they have learnt lessons and improved, but it isn't, it's again the same worst feeling. I don't know how to call it flagship killer it's actually a flagship loser.1* rating is for the following reasons:Camera: A35K flagship phone which only takes pics in one mode. It so worse that even the basic modes and stickers are missing. The camera does not even allow to change resolution (Megapixel), even a 5K phone does that. I went through some forums and people suggested to use Google camera or other third-party camera apps.Screen Quality: The phone came with pre-installed screen guard (off course with bubbles and a warning to only use official screen guard for the finger print to work properly), just wondering why does a flagship killer need a 100 Rs worth (or 20 Rs Chinese equivalent) screen-guard?  Prospective buyers just think of it, is it because of poor screen quality? cost cutting? Please note I spent exactly 6200 Rs to replace the screen of my first One plus phone, which again cracked 2nd time, after which I totally discarded the phone. One plus hasnâ€™t yet learned the lesson and again released a phone with substandard screen quality.Dust-Finger print Magnet: The back is made of Mirror back, it attracts not just dust but is a serious finger print magnet. Keep it on table for 2 min or hold it just for 1 min after thoroughly cleaning with a  soft cloth, it turns dirty in no time. The pre-installed screen guard also attracts too much dust. Why does a manufacturer himself give a free a back case, why? Just think of it, before purchasing.Low Battery Capacity: 3700 mAh is too low for a phone with such a specification.Poor Battery Backup: The battery backup is not so good, losing 20-30% battery overnight in idle mode. My Normal usage in a day 30-40 min calls, 1-2 hours of apps usage, 1-2 hours of music and 15-20 mins of forward videos without any games, battery hardly lasts.Poor Service Quality and expensive repair costs: One plus service quality is too poor, in hand experience from my first phone. They have hardly 2-3 proper service centres in big cities, the Queue's and waiting times are long and on top the spares or screen replacement costs are exorbitantly high. Just enquire the screen replacement costs from service centre before buying this phone.Free Labour: Please don't be a free labour to OnePlus. For every issue with OnePlus, you have to go through 10's of forums (including the official OnePlus forum) 100's of threads and 1000's of replies from other users and find out yourself how to fix the issue. On top of it we provide free feedback (actually free labour) so that they improve their next one. Just think of it are you buying a phone or doing a free labour ship to OnePlus, why Should we waste our time and money to do something, which one plus should do themselves?"
5,Gaurav Vats,Final Review after Using 5 Days.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Honest review after using it for 5 days which help you to buy this phone.I have started facing issue with the camera performance soon after i have purchased this phone.The issue was, when I open the camera in 5 out of 100 times its get stuck and I have to restart the device again to regain the camera access which is very irritating and not at all expected.I have filed the return request but still there are many verification and process are involved before Amazon decide weather the replacement will be given to the customer or not.If I am investing 38K then I do not compromise with any single quality or performance issue which comes in our regular use but apart from that everything is perfect in this phone.What I like about this phone?1. Built Quality is awesome looks very premium at the same time tough and durable.2. Work smooth and layout is clean.3. OS is also well optimized.4. few Drop design looks perfect.5. Many functions are very useful in our daily routine and I specially like phone answering on gesture without touching any receiving buttons.5. Battery life is amazing and unexpected..its easily goes 2 days in my regular use.6. The protective cover is also perfect for this phone as it's gives extra protection at all edges/corners.7. Night Mode Picture is awesome also you have an option to play with colours in the existing photo after capturing the image.What I do not like this phone?1. I can not say this is a slim phone. it's little bit like Motorola phones which looks little bulky and tough.2. Picture Quality is good but not as iPhones.3. Difficult to take moving object picture as 99 times you get blurred picture, or you have to play with settings for taking moving pictures.4. If you are using 1+6 then don't invest to upgrade to One Plus 6T.5. Missing Very much The Notification Light and Headphone Jack.Hope my review help you to buy this product."
6,Amazon Customer,Far from perfect,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Writing this review after using the product for around 7 months.I will first write about the shortcomings. Screen quality and display is not worth the price. It's good but similar quality of display can be seen in even sub-15000 RS smartphones. Night mode on the phone is really poor.After unlocking the phone,it takes 2-3 seconds to fully activate night mode.Even in Redmi 7 , a 6000 rs phone, night mode works instantly. Display calibration is also unsatisfactory and phone contnues to display and yellowish tone in any setting.Phone hasn't been able to utilise the notch space adequately and left side of notch remains vacant even when right side is crowded.Camera quality is certainly not flagship. Daylight photos are good but in low light conditions, photos  dont justify the price. I installed gcam which has led to huge improvement.Audio quality is again average and volume is pretty low even after reaching max. I don't know why they have punched two speakers when only one of them works.  Kind of a fraud honestlyIt's true that oxygen OS is clean and clutter free but certain features are required to make it more functional such as option to copy OTP when SMS comes to Mobile. When I click on any contact, it doesn't show me my call history with that contact and I have to call that contact and cut it before it rings to see call history which is so annoying.While browsing twitter,I open any website using inbuilt chrome (within twitter) and when I start scrolling up and down , the chrome extention crashes every single time and I have to kill the twitter and restart it again.Vibration is pretty weak.Among good things I found was it's good battery life, fast face unlock , HD call quality."
7,vandan bhardwaj,Not buying a OnePlus again,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Writing this review after two years of use. I know most of the people won't see this now but still wanted to put this across. This is my second Oneplus phone after using Oneplus 3 for 2 years and I have come to conclusion that OnePlus phones are not good for long term use. This phone faced the exact same problems that my previous Oneplus 3 faced. Buttons became brittle and non clicky after a year of use, Slider on the slide only worked for two modes and usb C port became loose and the worst part is all these things started happening right after my warranty expired.So, in short, if you are thinking of using any OnePlus for more than 2 years then it's going to be a tough ride. My suggestion would be to sell it off within an year of buying."
8,Rohit Shinde,Not worth money.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"One plus 6t was marketed as best smartphone of the market but it's not. I have used this for 3-4 months to tell difference. Before this I've used MI phone and they are better when it comes to user interface.Cons1. On screen fingerprint sensor is horrible. Face detection is horrible. Night time u have to use ur code to unlock ur phone.2. If you have google chromecast then one plus is a bad choice. U cannot caste amazing time video on TV. U can caste device but it'll show blind screen. Also u cannot watch HD quality on Netflix.3. It has major glich for sound. Sometimes u cannot reduce or increase sound it'll stay the same. If u r listening song and u connect bullet headphones then sound doesn't transfer to headphone, it'll continue from mobile speakers. Also it has lot of issues with Bluetooth, when disconnected from car Bluetooth device there is problem again with sound button. U have to restart ur phone to make it workable. The problem with is sound button is actually software problem and it's very annoying.4. It doesn't have IR sensor for universal remote. Which is very useful.Pros1. It's very fast.2. Camera is good quality.3. Speed charging is very good. I get full battery within 40 minute charge.Overall I am bit disappointed using this phone because they have not done proper research on user interface. Doesn't give premium feeling. My previous MI phone was very good in that case. Absolutely not worth 40k."
9,Hk,Defective and refurbished product - Please read complete review,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Hi Guys, Request you to read complete reviewâ€¦. This issue should not happen with anyone..I bought this product on 11th dec , i was very much excited to use the product. When i opened the phone i see the below issues.1.Error in application post every restart of device. (Image attached).2.Scroll appearing in the center of the screen. (Image attached) this goes away after restart and happen intermittently.3.Scratches on the phone from the day of receiving.i called to amazon customer care and informed the above issues and was asking for replacement to new phone .Customer care people said they can not replace immediately but will arrange the technician and after couple of follow-ups from my end to amazon service  they arranged a technician after one week.Today technician visited and I showed him the scroll bar issue in front of him and I told the issue will goaway after restart and he said ok lets restart the phone, we restarted and there was no scroll bar issues ( this is happening intermittently) and the technician has written the same and he also mentioned finger print is not working and some marks on the phone from day 1( which I have shown to him).But when the technician updated to amazon he said everything is fine , I contacted amazon to know the status and they said there is no issue found and technician updated the same.I got frustrated by the answer they gave me and I sent them the report which I Luckily I took the snapshot of the report what technician has  written in front of me along with the images which I have taken when I got the issues ( please see the images attached).Being a new 40 thousand product do I need to continue with the same restart when ever I get this issue (weired right) but the response from amazon customer says we can not help in replacing simply they are saying I need to use in the phone restarting whenever there is an issue.I was not willing to take the product from amazon but my cousin who is customer from the day one amazon started their services he suggested me to take the  product .I hope Amazon will give best service and keep their name in good terms by replacing the product.Please see the attachments which amazon is not able to see the issue in it ðŸ˜Š"
